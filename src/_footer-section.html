        Vane Brothers, a leading participant in coastal and harbor movements of petroleum products and ship bunkering, has been a major customer of U.S. yards. Capt. Jim Demske, who is in charge of newbuild construction
        at the Baltimore based vessel owner, explained his criteria for sizing up a potential builder of new equipment
        for Vane. He explained, “Among many considerations, I want to know the yard’s reputation for constructing
        the type of tug required by Vane Brothers. I need to be certain they can build the design to our specifi cations,
        deliver it in a timely manner, and bring it in at our budgeted cost.”
      </p>
      <p class="footer-section__paragraph">
        Recent Vane newbuilds have included three Assateague class ATBs (built at Conrad Shipyards with 4,400
        bhp tugs coupled to 80,000 bbl barges) and two Salisbury class push boats (3,000 bhp), suitable for the inland
        rivers. Two more of the push boats are under construction, at Chesapeake Shipbuilding (which has also carved
        out a niche in building small river cruise vessels for American Cruise Lines).
      </p>
      <p class="footer-section__paragraph">
        Capt. Demsky continued, “If the yard has been building tugs for many years, there is a good chance I have
        been aboard some of their tugs or designs. I would already have a good idea of what I like about their builds,
        their strengths and weaknesses, and what the yard can provide to ensure that new Vane vessels maximize
        safety, performance and crew comfort.”
      </p>
      <p class="footer-section__paragraph">
        Vane Brothers takes a hands-on approach, with Capt. Demsky telling Marine News, “I like to walk the yard and
        talk with management and supervisors to get a feel for the knowledge and expertise they offer. The rapport we
        are able to build is always important, since I will be interacting with yard personnel on a nearly daily basis for
        the length of the project. During the walk, I also look to see whether the yard is well kept and effi ciently laid out.
        If the yard is clean and organized, I feel better about entrusting them with a Vane Brothers project.”

          The American shipbuilding scene, filled with participants constructing all manner of vessels, has been
          navigating through stormy times (lately, yards along the Gulf Coast have literally been dealing with storms).
          The orders for newbuild, repair and conversion projects continue to fl ow in—albeit at a reduced pace—and 
          the boats and ships go down the ways into the water, but the overall panorama has seen tremendous sea changes 
          as the business has shifted.

          Maritime businesses worldwide have been grappling with currents both internal and external. Across the entire 
          landscape in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about operational changes that will continue into the future, 
          long after Americans are vaccinated. Most U.S. shipyards were identifi ed early on as “essential businesses”,
          and therefore continued working throughout 2020. The proactive attitude of one yard during 2020’s pandemic did 
          not go unnoticed, with Fincantieri Bay Shipbuilding (FBS) receiving the Northeast Wisconsin Service Award.
          As explained in a press release from FBS, “The award honors the unsung heroes of the coronavirus who helped keep
          Wisconsin moving while the state was shut down. Honorees are selected for going above and beyond the call of duty
          in their respective fi elds or industries.”

          Throughout the maritime world, again refl ecting broader trends, talk has turned to “decarbonization” (with reduced 
          CO2 going beyond notions of simply improving vessel effi ciency), which will have profound implications for vessel 
          propulsion and fuel choices.

          Initially, this trend has driven a movement toward liquefi ed natural gas (LNG) fueled propulsion.In Pascagoula, Miss., 
          the Halter Marine yard will soon be completing the tug barge combination Q-Ocean Service / Q-LNG 4000, for Q-LNG. 
          The 4,000 cubic meter unit will be contracted to Shell, and will be handling both ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore 
          transfers of LNG to vessels and to shoreside LNG distribution depots.

          With its Great Lakes location, FBS is also building a 28,000 dwt. self unloading bulk carrier for Interlake Steamship, 
          and delivered the dry bulk barge Michigan Trader to Van Enkevort Tug and Barge in August.

          Along the Gulf Coast, Eastern Shipbuilding- Panama City, Fla. has also been active in multiple segments. The yard is 
          in the midst of a three-vessel order for New York City’s Staten Island Ferry. The fi rst of the 4,500-passenger
          trio, Sgt Michael Ollis, is set to be delivered in late 2020 (after being delayed due to Hurricane Michael in 2018),
          with a second vessel, Sandy Ground, launched in June 2020. The yard has continued to work, in the midst of
          the pandemic and an active hurricane season. In August, Eastern, which had previously been a prodigious producer
          of tugboats, delivered the 5,100 hp Z-drive ship-handling tug A. Thomas Higgins to E.N. Bisso (following up on a
          sister vessel C.D. White delivered earlier in the year).

          Also in the Gulf, the Metal Shark facilities, encompassing three locations in Louisiana and Alabama, have been
          active, with a varied construction slate.

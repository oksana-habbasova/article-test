        Maritime Administration, will go way beyond their role in training maritime cadets. As National Security
        Multi-Mission Vessels, their capabilities will enable them to respond to natural disasters, and provide humanitarian
        aid. The vessels, set to join the National Defense Reserve Fleet, will have ro-ro capabilities (for heavy equipment)
        and extensive berthing capacity. NASSCO, with no additional deepsea commercial orders announced, is putting its
        tanker expertise to work, building a series of fl eet oilers for the U.S. Navy. Halter Marine is also constructing vessels
        for the Coast Guard and the Navy, and Eastern is building the Coast Guard’s fi rst offshore patrol cutters.

        Bollinger’s Lockport, La. yard scored a big win in late September with a U.S. Coast Guard awarding a newbuild
        contract, with four fast response cutters to be delivered during 2022 and 2023. The group also recently received
        an order for a fl oating drydock that will service U.S. Navy submarines at General Dynamics Electric Boat yard at
        Groton, Conn. Austal, another yard with commercial work in its past at its Mobile, Ala. yard (the old Bender facility),
        has delivered a fast transport ship to the U.S. Navy, with multiple transports also under construction. Like other
        yards, it has benefi ted from government work, in this case, with a specialty in troop transports and landing vessels.

        The sustainability trend looms large. In the not too distant future, additional U.S. built vessels will be needed
        to serve offshore wind energy projects. The rumor mill is whirring about numerous discussions said to be underway
        between project developers and U.S. owners regarding installation vessels. Matt Tremblay, ABS Senior Vice President, Global Offshore, told Marine News, “ABS is involved
        in a range of projects to support the development of the U.S. offshore wind industry, including providing services
        to vessels destined to be constructed in U.S. shipyards.” He added, “As the industry and the turbines continue to
        grow in size and complexity, the vessels needed to install them in U.S. waters will need to be built, and we are seeing
        increased demand for increasingly specialized vessels. ABS is involved in advanced discussions with key players on the
        development of further Jones Act vessels which will be key to the development of the U.S. industry.”

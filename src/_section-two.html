          The Bayou La Batre, Ala. facility (previously the Horizon Shipyard) recently
          delivered a 6,000 hp boat to Florida Marine Transporters (FMT), the fi rst of a three boat order, and the yard’s
          fi rst towboat for the inland marketplace. The Metal Shark
          yards have also continued to deliver ferries to NYC Ferry
          (in New York) and to Potomac Water Taxi, in the Washington, D.C. area. Metal Shark, also a prolifi c builder of
          fast boats for law enforcement and for military users, credits “series production” to its ability to deliver vessels rapidly
          and at scale, at a time that cities such as New York seek to

          A different sort of environmental theme (against a backdrop of increased funding for dredging) is evidenced most
          recently with Eastern Shipbuilding beginning construction
          on a second new 8,550-cubic-yard trailing suction hopper
          dredge for Weeks Marine Inc. (with a previous unit delivered in 2017). Elsewhere, Conrad Shipyard is building a
          6,500-cubic-yard TSHD for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock
          Corporation. And the Keppel AmFELS yard at Brownsville, Texas announced an order for a 15,000-cubic-yard
          hopper dredge, to be delivered in 2023 to Manson Construction. The yard (historically a builder of jack-up rigs) is
          also constructing two LNG-fueled containerships that will
          be deployed by Pasha Hawaii in the Jones Act trades from
          the West Coast.

          On the West Coast, General Dynamics’ NASSCO, in
          San Diego (which, like the Philly Shipyard on the East
          Coast, had earlier successes in delivering multi-vessel series
          of Jones Act suitable double hulled tankers as the pre-OPA
          fl eet was being phased out), delivered Lurline, the fi rst of
          two 3,500 TEU container vessels to Matson, which also
          boast a 500 vehicle garage capacity. A second vessel, Matsonia, is expected to be delivered in late 2020. The vessels, readily upgradable for LNG fueling in the future, will
          serve in the line’s West Coast- Hawaii trades.

          With oil price wars and trade wars, economists can argue about whether we are in a “slowdown” or a “recession”.
          However, weak demand on the commercial side (energy
          and also agricultural) has seen a counterbalance from the
          government side. The Philly Shipyard has chosen to pivot
          from commercial to government work- with the contract
          award emphasizing a need to infuse commercial best-practices. The Philly Shipyard, which had completed a pair of
          container vessels for Matson, is now set to begin construction, initially, of two training ships destined for maritime
          academies (with the fi rst going to Fort Schuyler- State
          University of New York). The newbuilds, with Tote Inc
          managing the actual contracting and construction process
          for the U.S.

          The American shipbuilding scene, filled with participants constructing all manner of vessels, has been
          navigating through stormy times (lately, yards along the Gulf Coast have literally been dealing with storms).
          The orders for newbuild, repair and conversion projects continue to fl ow in—albeit at a reduced pace—and 
          the boats and ships go down the ways into the water, but the overall panorama has seen tremendous sea changes 
          as the business has shifted.
        </p>
        <p class="section-one__paragraph">
          Maritime businesses worldwide have been grappling with currents both internal and external. Across the entire 
          landscape in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about operational changes that will continue into the future, 
          long after Americans are vaccinated. Most U.S. shipyards were identifi ed early on as “essential businesses”,
          and therefore continued working throughout 2020. The proactive attitude of one yard during 2020’s pandemic did 
          not go unnoticed, with Fincantieri Bay Shipbuilding (FBS) receiving the Northeast Wisconsin Service Award.
          As explained in a press release from FBS, “The award honors the unsung heroes of the coronavirus who helped keep
          Wisconsin moving while the state was shut down. Honorees are selected for going above and beyond the call of duty
          in their respective fi elds or industries.”
        </p>
        <p class="section-one__paragraph">
          Throughout the maritime world, again refl ecting broader trends, talk has turned to “decarbonization” (with reduced 
          CO2 going beyond notions of simply improving vessel effi ciency), which will have profound implications for vessel 
          propulsion and fuel choices. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section-one__text-right">
        <p class="section-one__paragraph">
          Initially, this trend has driven a movement toward liquefi ed natural gas (LNG) fueled propulsion.In Pascagoula, Miss., 
          the Halter Marine yard will soon be completing the tug barge combination Q-Ocean Service / Q-LNG 4000, for Q-LNG. 
          The 4,000 cubic meter unit will be contracted to Shell, and will be handling both ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore 
          transfers of LNG to vessels and to shoreside LNG distribution depots.
        </p>
        <p class="section-one__paragraph">
          With its Great Lakes location, FBS is also building a 28,000 dwt. self unloading bulk carrier for Interlake Steamship, 
          and delivered the dry bulk barge Michigan Trader to Van Enkevort Tug and Barge in August.
        </p>
        <p class="section-one__paragraph">
          Along the Gulf Coast, Eastern Shipbuilding- Panama City, Fla. has also been active in multiple segments. The yard is 
          in the midst of a three-vessel order for New York City’s Staten Island Ferry. The fi rst of the 4,500-passenger
          trio, Sgt Michael Ollis, is set to be delivered in late 2020 (after being delayed due to Hurricane Michael in 2018),
          with a second vessel, Sandy Ground, launched in June 2020. The yard has continued to work, in the midst of
          the pandemic and an active hurricane season. In August, Eastern, which had previously been a prodigious producer
          of tugboats, delivered the 5,100 hp Z-drive ship-handling tug A. Thomas Higgins to E.N. Bisso (following up on a
          sister vessel C.D. White delivered earlier in the year). 
        </p>
        <p class="section-one__paragraph">
          Also in the Gulf, the Metal Shark facilities, encompassing three locations in Louisiana and Alabama, have been
          active, with a varied construction slate.

          The Bayou La Batre, Ala. facility (previously the Horizon Shipyard) recently
          delivered a 6,000 hp boat to Florida Marine Transporters (FMT), the fi rst of a three boat order, and the yard’s
          fi rst towboat for the inland marketplace. The Metal Shark
          yards have also continued to deliver ferries to NYC Ferry
          (in New York) and to Potomac Water Taxi, in the Washington, D.C. area. Metal Shark, also a prolifi c builder of

          A different sort of environmental theme (against a backdrop of increased funding for dredging) is evidenced most
          recently with Eastern Shipbuilding beginning construction
          on a second new 8,550-cubic-yard trailing suction hopper
          dredge for Weeks Marine Inc. (with a previous unit delivered in 2017). Elsewhere, Conrad Shipyard is building a
          6,500-cubic-yard TSHD for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock
          Corporation. And the Keppel AmFELS yard at Brownsville, Texas announced an order for a 15,000-cubic-yard
          hopper dredge, to be delivered in 2023 to Manson Construction. The yard (historically a builder of jack-up rigs) is
          also constructing two LNG-fueled containerships that will
          be deployed by Pasha Hawaii in the Jones Act trades from
          the West Coast.

        <p class="section-two__paragraph">
          On the West Coast, General Dynamics’ NASSCO, in
          San Diego (which, like the Philly Shipyard on the East
          Coast, had earlier successes in delivering multi-vessel series
          of Jones Act suitable double hulled tankers as the pre-OPA
          fl eet was being phased out), delivered Lurline, the fi rst of
          two 3,500 TEU container vessels to Matson, which also
          boast a 500 vehicle garage capacity. A second vessel, Matsonia, is expected to be delivered in late 2020. The vessels, readily upgradable for LNG fueling in the future, will
          serve in the line’s West Coast- Hawaii trades.

          With oil price wars and trade wars, economists can argue about whether we are in a “slowdown” or a “recession”.
          However, weak demand on the commercial side (energy
          and also agricultural) has seen a counterbalance from the
          government side. The Philly Shipyard has chosen to pivot
          from commercial to government work- with the contract
          award emphasizing a need to infuse commercial best-practices. The Philly Shipyard, which had completed a pair of
          container vessels for Matson, is now set to begin construction, initially, of two training ships destined for maritime
          academies (with the fi rst going to Fort Schuyler- State
          University of New York). The newbuilds, with Tote Inc

        aid. The vessels, set to join the National Defense Reserve Fleet, will have ro-ro capabilities (for heavy equipment)
        and extensive berthing capacity. NASSCO, with no additional deepsea commercial orders announced, is putting its
        tanker expertise to work, building a series of fl eet oilers for the U.S. Navy. Halter Marine is also constructing vessels

        Bollinger’s Lockport, La. yard scored a big win in late September with a U.S. Coast Guard awarding a newbuild
        contract, with four fast response cutters to be delivered during 2022 and 2023. The group also recently received
        an order for a fl oating drydock that will service U.S. Navy submarines at General Dynamics Electric Boat yard at
        Groton, Conn. Austal, another yard with commercial work in its past at its Mobile, Ala. yard (the old Bender facility),
        has delivered a fast transport ship to the U.S. Navy, with multiple transports also under construction. Like other
        yards, it has benefi ted from government work, in this case, with a specialty in troop transports and landing vessels.

        The sustainability trend looms large. In the not too distant future, additional U.S. built vessels will be needed
        to serve offshore wind energy projects. The rumor mill is whirring about numerous discussions said to be underway
        between project developers and U.S. owners regarding installation vessels. Matt Tremblay, ABS Senior Vice President, Global Offshore, told Marine News, “ABS is involved
        in a range of projects to support the development of the U.S. offshore wind industry, including providing services
        to vessels destined to be constructed in U.S. shipyards.” He added, “As the industry and the turbines continue to
        grow in size and complexity, the vessels needed to install them in U.S. waters will need to be built, and we are seeing
        increased demand for increasingly specialized vessels. ABS is involved in advanced discussions with key players on the
        development of further Jones Act vessels which will be key to the development of the U.S. industry.”

        Vane Brothers, a leading participant in coastal and harbor movements of petroleum products and ship bunkering, has been a major customer of U.S. yards. Capt. Jim Demske, who is in charge of newbuild construction
        at the Baltimore based vessel owner, explained his criteria for sizing up a potential builder of new equipment
        for Vane. He explained, “Among many considerations, I want to know the yard’s reputation for constructing
        the type of tug required by Vane Brothers. I need to be certain they can build the design to our specifi cations,
        deliver it in a timely manner, and bring it in at our budgeted cost.”
      </p>
      <p class="footer-section__paragraph">
        Recent Vane newbuilds have included three Assateague class ATBs (built at Conrad Shipyards with 4,400
        bhp tugs coupled to 80,000 bbl barges) and two Salisbury class push boats (3,000 bhp), suitable for the inland
        rivers. Two more of the push boats are under construction, at Chesapeake Shipbuilding (which has also carved
        out a niche in building small river cruise vessels for American Cruise Lines).
      </p>
      <p class="footer-section__paragraph">
        Capt. Demsky continued, “If the yard has been building tugs for many years, there is a good chance I have
        been aboard some of their tugs or designs. I would already have a good idea of what I like about their builds,
        their strengths and weaknesses, and what the yard can provide to ensure that new Vane vessels maximize
        safety, performance and crew comfort.”
      </p>
      <p class="footer-section__paragraph">
        Vane Brothers takes a hands-on approach, with Capt. Demsky telling Marine News, “I like to walk the yard and
        talk with management and supervisors to get a feel for the knowledge and expertise they offer. The rapport we
        are able to build is always important, since I will be interacting with yard personnel on a nearly daily basis for
        the length of the project. During the walk, I also look to see whether the yard is well kept and effi ciently laid out.
        If the yard is clean and organized, I feel better about entrusting them with a Vane Brothers project.”
